# horiseon

A refactoring exercise - to reformat an existing webpage with proper semantic html and alt tags to increase accessibility.

I started by consolidating the classes, there was a lot of unneeded repetition as each section was defined as its own class.

I added alt tags to all the images.

I made a lot of classes no longer classes, but just referenced the attribute (i.e. header tag instead of div class="header", changing generic divs to main, aside, etc.), thereby making the html semantic.

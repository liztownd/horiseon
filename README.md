# horiseon

A refactoring exercise - to reformat an existing webpage with proper semantic html and alt tags to increase accessibility.

I started by consolidating the classes, there was a lot of unneeded repetition as each section was defined as its own class.

I added alt tags to all the images.

I made a lot of classes no longer classes, but just referenced the attribute (i.e. <code><header></code> tag instead of <code><div class="header"></code>, changing generic <code><div></code>s to <code><main></code>, <code><aside></code>, etc.), thereby making the html semantic.
